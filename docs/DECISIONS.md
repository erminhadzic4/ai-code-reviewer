# Decisions

Format: date, decision, why, alternatives rejected. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-10-08: Single monorepo
Frontend and backend live in one repository (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`).
Why: one link shows the whole project, shared API contract changes in one commit,
solo project with no separate release cycles.
Rejected: separate frontend and backend repositories.

## 2026-10-08: JWT login and registration from V1
Reviews belong to users. Why: needed for history, per-user usage limits, and a possible
paid feature later. Rejected: anonymous usage in V1.

## 2026-10-08: Free-only stack
Gemini free tier and local Ollama, free GitHub Actions. Anything that cannot be run
for free is not done.

## 2026-10-08: Local only for now, public deployment optional later
The app runs locally with the developer's own Gemini key. A public version is a possible
later option (see "Later" in ROADMAP.md).
Why: the free Gemini quota is shared by every user of one key, and free hosting has limits,
so a public version needs usage limits and abuse protection first.
Rejected: building public deployment and its protections now.

## 2026-10-08: Frontend direction
The approved frontend design mockup (dark theme: landing page and review report) is the
reference for the frontend (M7).
